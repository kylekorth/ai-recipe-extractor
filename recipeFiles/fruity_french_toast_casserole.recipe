## Ingredients
- Bread cubes (whole-grain) | 8 cups | 
- Fruit (sliced or chopped—fresh, frozen or canned) | 2 cups | 
- Eggs | 4, slightly beaten | 
- Nonfat or 1% milk | 1 cup | 
- Vanilla | 2 teaspoons | 
- Sugar | ¼ cup | 
- Margarine or butter | ¼ cup, softened | 
- Sugar | ¼ cup | 
- Flour (all purpose or whole wheat) | ½ cup | 

## Instructions
1. Grease an 8 x 8-inch baking dish or 2-quart casserole dish. Add bread cubes and fruit.
2. In a medium bowl, blend the eggs, milk, vanilla, and sugar. Pour over the bread cubes and fruit. Stir gently to wet all of the bread with the egg mixture.
3. Cover and refrigerate until all of the liquid is absorbed (30 minutes), or overnight.
4. Just before baking, remove the casserole from the refrigerator. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
5. Make the topping: In a small bowl, combine the margarine or butter, sugar, and flour with a fork until crumbly.
6. Uncover the casserole and sprinkle the topping over the fruit. Bake until completely set and starting to brown (160 degrees F in the center), about 35 to 40 minutes.
